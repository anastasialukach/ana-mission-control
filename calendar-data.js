        text: "Starting an experiment today.\n\nEvery morning I'm getting a curated briefing on what's happening in IR, capital formation, and the Gulf LP ecosystem.\n\nThen turning it into posts — not reshares. My actual take, with data.\n\nThe goal: show up with substance every single day. Not thought leadership fluff. Real insights from someone who's raised $10M+ from family offices and managed 1,000+ investor relationships.\n\nDay 1. Let's see where this goes.\n\nWhat topic should I cover first? Drop it below 👇",
