        text: "A senior hedge fund manager just turned down a London offer.\n\nNot because of the role. Because of the math.\n\nDubai/Abu Dhabi hedge fund buyout: $20 million, tax-free.\nLondon equivalent: $11 million after tax ($20M gross).\n\nThat's a $9 million difference. For doing the same job.\n\nThis isn't new — the Gulf has had 0% income tax for years. What's new is how aggressively UAE-based funds are using it as a recruiting wedge.\n\nPost-bonus season, the pitch is simple:\n→ Same or better comp structure\n→ Zero income tax\n→ Growing AUM base (family offices, sovereigns, institutional allocators shifting East)\n→ Dubai/Abu Dhabi infrastructure now matches London/Singapore\n\nThe result? A steady stream of senior talent making the move.\n\nI've watched this shift accelerate over the last 18 months. It's not just about tax anymore. It's about where capital is flowing. Gulf family offices and sovereign funds are allocating more to alternatives. If you're running a hedge fund strategy, being closer to that LP base matters.\n\nThe talent migration follows the capital migration.\n\nFor fund managers raising from Gulf LPs: this is your competitive landscape now. The funds you're pitching aren't just competing on performance — they're competing on domicile, tax efficiency, and proximity to the fastest-growing allocator base in the world.\n\nIf you're still thinking of Dubai as a "nice to have" LP relationship, you're five years behind.\n\nAgree?",
        why: "Concrete numbers ($20M vs $11M after tax). Insider observation of 18-month trend. Ties talent to capital flows. Positions Ana as close to the action. Classic engagement CTA."

It's a full pivot from Silicon Valley to Asia + Middle East.\n\nThe capital is moving. The question is whether founders are following it.\n\nAre you?",

        text: "Fundraising reality check for Q1 2026:\n\n✅ What's working:\n• Tikehau Capital closed a $1B+ private debt secondaries fund ABOVE target\n• Fintech VC rebounded 35% in 2025 ($53B total) — first gain in 4 years\n• Egypt committed $135M to phase 2 of national VC support program\n• General Catalyst pledged $5B to India + MENA over 5 years\n\n❌ What's not:\n• Blue Owl permanently gated a retail private credit fund (see Thursday's news)\n• Nigeria PE firms froze deals over new 30% tax on carried interest\n• Traditional VC fundraising timelines still stretched 12-18+ months\n\nWhat I'm seeing from the Gulf LP side:\n\n1️⃣ Secondaries are still moving. LPs want liquidity solutions, not another 10-year lock-up.\n\n2️⃣ Fintech stabilized. The "fintech is dead" narrative from 2023 was wrong. Sector matured, capital came back.\n\n3️⃣ Emerging markets (MENA, India, parts of Africa) are getting direct sovereign + institutional backing. If you're raising for these regions, the capital pools exist — but you need to be talking to the right offices.\n\n4️⃣ Private credit is having a reckoning. Gates and liquidity mismatches are no longer theoretical risks.\n\nThe fundraising environment isn't "back to normal." It's segmented. Some funds are closing fast and oversubscribed. Others can't get a first close after 18 months.\n\nThe difference? Thesis clarity, LP alignment, and understanding where capital is actually flowing in 2026.\n\nIf you're a GP struggling to raise, ask yourself: are you pitching the strategy LPs wanted in 2021, or the one they're actually allocating to now?\n\nWhat are you seeing in fundraising right now? Is it easier or harder than 6 months ago?",
        why: "Structured format (what's working / what's not). Multiple data points. Gulf LP lens. Practical takeaways for GPs. Ends with open question to drive comments."

The region isn't just allocating capital to AI — it's building the infrastructure to own the value chain.\n\nIf you're raising for AI-native companies and you're not talking to Gulf LPs, you're missing the most aggressive capital pools in the market right now.\n\nWhat's your read on sovereign funds going direct into frontier AI?

        text: "BREAKING: Blue Owl Capital — one of the largest US private credit managers — permanently freezes investor withdrawals\n\nBlue Owl manages over $200B in assets. Now investors in their retail private credit fund can't get their money out. Not a temporary pause — a permanent lock on capital. Private credit stocks dropped across the board.\n\nGulf family offices have been cautious on private credit for years. This is why.\n\nPrivate credit exploded because yields looked amazing when rates were low. Funds marketed \"stable returns\" with \"low correlation to public markets.\" The structures worked when inflows covered outflows. Everyone was happy.\n\nBut if you've ever sat across from an LP who actually manages illiquid allocations, you know the first question is always about the exit. Not the yield. Not the IRR deck. The exit.\n\nThe moment inflows slow, gates are the only tool managers have. And once one fund gates, redemption requests accelerate everywhere else. We saw this exact playbook in real estate funds in 2022-2023.\n\nWhat's different this time:\n\n➢ This is the retail channel. Institutional LPs have locked capital with known timelines. Retail investors were told this was \"accessible private credit.\" Very different expectations.\n\n➢ Private credit grew to $1.7T globally by promising something that doesn't quite exist — liquid access to illiquid assets.\n\n➢ The funds that raised fastest are the ones most exposed now. Speed of capital formation doesn't equal quality of capital structure.\n\nThere's a reason the smartest allocators I've been around spend more time on redemption mechanics than on yield projections. It's not the return that kills you. It's the gate you didn't read.\n\nThe question isn't whether Blue Owl is an isolated event. It's how many other funds are one bad quarter away from the same decision.",
