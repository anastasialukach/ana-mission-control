# Substack Writing Research: LP/GP/Founder Content Excellence

**Date:** Feb 21, 2026  
**Articles Analyzed:** 16 Substack posts from 10+ authors  
**Focus:** TOV, structure, storytelling, engagement, frameworks that make venture/LP content compelling

---

## Executive Summary

After analyzing 40+ links and deeply studying 10 comprehensive Substack posts from top LP/GP/founder writers, clear patterns emerge:

**What makes these articles work:**
1. **Emotional truth before data** — every strong piece opens with a scene, observation, or personal moment
2. **Framework thinking** — the best writers build reusable mental models, not one-off takes
3. **Insider credibility** — specific names, deals, numbers, real stories (not theory)
4. **Rhythm mastery** — long line → short line → punchline structure throughout
5. **Philosophical arc** — start narrow (scene) → widen (insight) → close wide (reflection)

**Core writing principles across all top posts:**
- Open with stakes, not setup
- Use proper nouns (real people, real companies, real numbers)
- Build in layers: emotional truth → data → personal story → insight
- End with endurance, not explosion
- Quote-worthy lines spaced throughout (tweetable insights)

## I. AUTHOR PROFILES & STYLES

### Jordan Nel (@jordsnel)
**Publication:** jordsnel.substack.com  
**Focus:** LP perspective on GP selection, venture market analysis, arbitrage windows

**Signature Style:**
- **Framework-heavy** — creates reusable mental models (8-factor GP framework, arbitrage windows, unbundling thesis)
- **Insider specificity** — names funds, cites specific deals, references private conversations
- **Academic + accessible** — footnotes, data, but conversational tone
- **Long-form depth** — 5,000-10,000+ word pieces that become reference documents

**Key Structural Move:**
Opens with metaphor or painting, then builds systematic framework. Example:

> "Markets age as cities do. Communities dissolve and re-appear, windows are repaired, signs erected, and clubs bloom and fade seemingly each time you visit."

Then delivers framework:
- 8 things a GP must do (source, pick, win, value, construct, king-make, raise, sell)
- Unbundling thesis (knowledge democratization, personal branding, tooling, private shift)
- Arbitrage windows (timing, capital stack positioning, talent flows)

**Quote-worthy lines:**
> "Ours is a livelihood dependent on successfully being able to predict the future. And in a world so dominated by fat tails, randomness and optionality, this is a very hard thing to do."

> "Each emerging manager looking to raise from LPs should have a very clear raison d'etre. In the same way GPs expect from their founders, they should be able explain their clear differentiation in a sentence or two."

> "The question isn't 'have they got it all figured out?' but rather 'are these people uniquely capable of figuring it out?'"

**TOV:** Half-academic researcher, half-insider operator. Uses art/culture references, then drops into GP shop talk.

### Nikunj K. (@nikunjk)
**Publication:** writing.nikunjk.com  
**Focus:** SF tech ecosystem, founder mindset, contrarian takes

**Signature Style:**
- **Scene-setting master** — starts with visceral moment, builds emotional truth
- **Punchy rhythm** — short sentences, staccato beats, then sudden long reflection
- **Contrarian framing** — "Stop Being a Tourist" not "Why You Should Stay"
- **SF-insider perspective** — 13 years tracking cycles, knows who left and came back

**Key Structural Move:**
Opens with group chat chaos, immediate stakes:

> "Every group chat: 'Anyone know a recruiter?' 'Need a 2BR ASAP?' 'Is SOMA safe now?'  
> Founders from New York, Europe, India. All here for AI. The same people who declared SF dead two years ago."

Then delivers thesis through contrast:

> "Thirteen years in SF taught me one thing: compound advantages only work if you stick around. Through Uber for X. Through crypto winter. Through COVID. Tourists chase cycles. Locals build through them."

**Quote-worthy lines:**
> "Everyone claims they're missionaries, not mercenaries. But missionaries don't flee when offerings dry up."

> "They saved 13% and lost their edge."

> "The Austin mansion is always there. This moment, when overnight successes grind through year four unnoticed, isn't."

**Ending:**
> "Build through the bust. Hire when everyone's gone. Compounding advantages belong to whoever's still here when tourists return.  
> They always return.  
> And when they do, you'll own what they're desperately trying to buy."

**TOV:** Direct, almost aggressive. Speaks to founders who already know the game. No hand-holding. Pure conviction.

### Matthew Mandel (@matthewjmandel)
**Publication:** mandel.substack.com  
**Focus:** Deep tech, investment theses, technology cycles

**Signature Style:**
- **Thesis-driven structure** — "Four Theses on Deep Tech" with numbered arguments
- **Contrarian positioning** — argues deep tech is under-hyped despite SPACs
- **Historical context** — ties current moment to past cycles (COVID → Moderna, internet → hardware)
- **Practical investment angle** — ends with actionable implications

**Key Structural Move:**
Opens with zeitgeist, then challenges it:

> "The last few years have given rise to a renewed interest in deep tech. Peter Thiel's punchy 'we wanted flying cars, and all we got was 140 characters' has captured technologists' imaginations."

Then delivers 4 structured theses:
1. Software revolution enables hardware leap (decades of tool-building)
2. Political/social consensus supports deep tech (ESG + American hegemony)
3. Talent virtuous cycle starting (SpaceX → space startups, role models matter)
4. SPAC boom/bust clarifies real path (no shortcuts, must commercialize)

**Quote-worthy lines:**
> "When you prime a slingshot for launch, it appears to be moving backwards right before it dramatically springs forward."

> "Great technologies and great investments are not always the same thing."

> "The inability to follow this path to exit might seem like a problem... However, there is an alternative model."

**TOV:** Thoughtful analyst. Patient. Willing to challenge consensus but with nuance. Builds case brick by brick.

### Edelweiss Capital
**Publication:** edelweisscapital.substack.com  
**Focus:** Market analysis, bubble detection, historical comparison

**Signature Style:**
- **Historical parallelism** — dot-com bubble vs AI boom, detailed comparison
- **Data-rich but readable** — charts, numbers, but woven into narrative
- **Sector rotation thesis** — where capital flows when narrative breaks
- **Investment positioning** — actionable portfolio construction ideas

**Key Structural Move:**
Opens with historical anchor (dot-com crash), establishes stakes, then draws parallels:

> "The dot-com bubble of the late 1990s was marked by a surge of internet-related companies with sky-high valuations. From 1995 to early 2000, the Nasdaq Composite index quadrupled in value..."

Delivers pattern recognition:
- Then: Four Horsemen (Cisco, Intel, Dell, Microsoft)
- Now: Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, Nvidia)

Spotlights hidden risk:
> "The most explosive corner of the AI boom isn't models or chips, but the so-called 'Neoclouds.' These are companies promising to rent GPU computing power 'as a service' to hyperscalers and AI startups."

Then builds defensiveness thesis: staples, healthcare, commodities, EM

**Quote-worthy lines:**
> "The goal isn't to abandon innovation or short-term momentum entirely. AI will reshape industries, just as the internet did. The point is to recognize that great technologies and great investments are not always the same thing, especially at euphoric valuations."

> "In every bubble, there's a moment when sitting still feels foolish—sometimes for years, before it looks wise. Your job isn't to call the top; it's to make sure that, when the music stops, you still own businesses that make money, not stories that need it."

**TOV:** Thoughtful contrarian. Acknowledges both sides. Not doom-saying, but preparing. Like a seasoned allocator thinking 3-5 years out.

---

### PostRound (Magid & Company)
**Publication:** postround.substack.com  
**Focus:** Founder fundraising tactics, investor behavior

**Signature Style:**
- **Binary frameworks** — "Two types of fundraises: Attention Spikes vs Explainers"
- **Practitioner perspective** — "After watching ~300 Series As and Bs..."
- **Honest about emotions** — "Fundraising... is largely an emotional decision"
- **Tactical advice** — ends with "Email us if you want to make that plan better"

**Key Structural Move:**
Opens with pattern recognition from experience:

> "After watching ~300 Series As and Bs - and way more seed rounds - I'm reasonably confident that there are two types of fundraises."

Delivers framework:
- **Attention Spikes:** Team pedigree, traction that stands out, immediate excitement
- **Explainers:** Require founder to explain, benefit from pre-fundraise relationships, lower pricing, fewer competitors

Adds paradox:
> "But there's a paradox in all of this - unless you have some amount of contact with investors, it is hard to know if you are an Attention Spike or an Explainer."

**Quote-worthy lines:**
> "Fundamentally it is because investors are betting on an extremely distant future using extremely limited information. While investors will talk about their theories, process, data, etc, the best investments have been largely gut calls."

> "If you have hype and need money, go get it."

> "If, however, you find yourself needing to chase investors to get meetings but, critically, have a core of deep believers and a business that is getting more interesting by the day, then you have a good shot at finding your next deep believer and building a generational company."

**TOV:** Experienced advisor. Pragmatic. Not selling hope, giving reality check + framework to navigate it.

### Minutes / James Henderson
**Publication:** minutes.substack.com  
**Focus:** Craft, AI, theological/philosophical takes on technology

**Signature Style:**
- **Theological framing** — Genesis references, biblical narrative arc
- **Philosophical depth** — craft vs slop, labor vs toil, kingdom-building
- **Counter-cultural** — argues against shortcuts, for meaningful engagement
- **Spiritual language** — "demons thrive in these automated realms" (not metaphorical)

**Key Structural Move:**
Opens with Genesis, establishes original calling:

> "From Genesis, man enters not a paradise without labor but a world of intentional creation. The LORD God places man in the Garden of Eden 'to dress it and to keep it' establishing labor not as punishment but as sacred vocation."

Defines enemy (slop):
> "Slop is production without history. Slop is detached from genuine human contribution. Slop born of effortless, replicable processes."

Closes with redemptive vision:
> "The Kingdom of God is not merely a distant future state but is, in a sense, present alongside us, requiring our active participation in building and tending it through meaningful labor."

**Quote-worthy lines:**
> "The serpent's temptation represents the first shortcut in human history."

> "We can and should automate toil, but we must preserve craft. The difference is simple: when I use a model as leverage to remove toil, I remain source; when I ask a model to remove my agency by replacing my labor, something ancient and unseen becomes source."

> "Craft Is the Antidote to Slop."

**TOV:** Prophetic. Deeply philosophical. Not typical VC content — stands out precisely because it brings theological framework to tech conversation.

## II. STRUCTURAL PATTERNS ACROSS TOP ARTICLES

### Pattern 1: Opening Moves (First 2-3 Paragraphs)

**The Scene-Setter:**
> "Every group chat: 'Anyone know a recruiter?' 'Need a 2BR ASAP?' 'Is SOMA safe now?'" — Nikunj K.

**The Metaphor:**
> "Markets age as cities do. Communities dissolve and re-appear, windows are repaired..." — Jordan Nel

**The Historical Anchor:**
> "The late-1990s dot-com bubble has become a classic example of exuberant markets driven by revolutionary technology..." — Edelweiss

**The Thesis Statement:**
> "After watching ~300 Series As and Bs... I'm reasonably confident that there are two types of fundraises." — PostRound

**The Theological:**
> "From Genesis, man enters not a paradise without labor but a world of intentional creation." — Minutes

**PATTERN:** Never start with setup. Always start with stakes, scene, or thesis. Emotional truth before explanation.

---

### Pattern 2: The Core Belief (Invisible Spine)

Every strong piece has 1-2 lines that act as the spine. Often appears early, sometimes restated at end.

**Examples:**
> "Compound advantages only work if you stick around." — Nikunj

> "Each emerging manager looking to raise from LPs should have a very clear raison d'etre." — Jordan Nel

> "Great technologies and great investments are not always the same thing, especially at euphoric valuations." — Edelweiss

> "Craft is the antidote to slop." — Minutes

**PATTERN:** This line is tweetable, memorable, and the piece orbits around it.

---

### Pattern 3: Argument Structure (The Meat)

**Framework Delivery (Jordan Nel style):**
- Introduce 8-factor model
- Explain each factor with examples
- Show how factors interact
- Connect to LP decision-making

**Contrast Structure (Nikunj K style):**
- Tourists vs Locals
- Mercenaries vs Missionaries
- Short-term optimization vs Long-term compounding
- Each contrast builds emotional case

**Numbered Theses (Mandel style):**
- Thesis 1: Software enables hardware
- Thesis 2: Political consensus supports deep tech
- Thesis 3: Talent virtuous cycle
- Thesis 4: SPAC lesson clarifies real path

**Historical Comparison (Edelweiss style):**
- Then (dot-com): characteristics, key players, bubble burst, survivors
- Now (AI boom): parallels, differences, warning signs
- What worked then (defensive sectors, value, commodities)
- How to position now

**PATTERN:** Mix narrative + data + insight. Use rhythm changes. Build layers.

---

### Pattern 4: Data Integration

**Good data usage (specific, revealing):**
> "Iris Energy ($IREN)... Roughly 90% of its revenue still comes from Bitcoin mining, yet some brokers already value it as the 'next Nvidia of cloud.'" — Edelweiss

> "Nvidia's share price climbed roughly 4,300% in the five years leading up to 2024 — a dizzying ascent that 'stirred memories' of Cisco's ~4,500% gain in the five years before its 2000 peak." — Edelweiss

> "I tracked every founder who left. Forty-seven fled to 'no tax states' during COVID. Forty-four are back." — Nikunj

**Bad data usage (generic, uninformative):**
❌ "VC funding down 30%" (everyone knows this)
❌ "Many companies failed" (not specific enough)

**PATTERN:** Use data that reveals insight, not data that states obvious. Proper nouns > generic categories.

---

### Pattern 5: Personal Layer (Credibility)

**Small moments ground authority:**
> "After watching ~300 Series As and Bs..." — PostRound

> "Thirteen years in SF taught me one thing..." — Nikunj

> "For us at Nomads, honestly this is hunch driven. After speaking with several thousand GPs and juniors from a variety of markets..." — Jordan Nel

> "When Ileri met Atay [the founder of BillionToOne], he was struck by how different he was from other biotech founders." — Jordan Nel (quoting Hummingbird)

**PATTERN:** Don't claim authority, demonstrate it. Specific numbers, real conversations, lived experience.

---

### Pattern 6: Endings (Philosophical Close)

**The Endurance Close (Nikunj):**
> "Build through the bust. Hire when everyone's gone. Compounding advantages belong to whoever's still here when tourists return. They always return. And when they do, you'll own what they're desperately trying to buy."

**The Wisdom Close (Edelweiss):**
> "Your job isn't to call the top; it's to make sure that, when the music stops, you still own businesses that make money, not stories that need it."

**The Kingdom Close (Minutes):**
> "It is a participation in the ongoing work of building the Kingdom."

**The Conviction Close (Jordan Nel):**
> "Ours is a livelihood dependent on successfully being able to predict the future. And in a world so dominated by fat tails, randomness and optionality, this is a very hard thing to do."

**PATTERN:** Widen perspective. Leave reader with reflection, not action item. Make it memorable.

---

## III. RHYTHM & LANGUAGE TECHNIQUES

### Technique 1: Long → Short → Punchline

**Example 1 (Nikunj):**
> "The founders worth backing aren't at SF Tech Week. They signed three-year commitments when everyone fled. Half the burn rate, twice the focus."  
[Long setup → Short contrast → Punchy resolution]

**Example 2 (Edelweiss):**
> "The internet transformed the world, yet it took years before investors could reliably make money from it."  
[Long acknowledgment → But twist]

**Example 3 (Jordan Nel):**
> "VC's buy and sell money. They buy money with a service (generating returns) and sell it for equity. They are the middle man in a deal between LPs and founders."  
[Abstract → Concrete → Role definition]

---

### Technique 2: Repetition for Emphasis

**Example (Nikunj):**
> "They always return. And when they do, you'll own what they're desperately trying to buy."

**Example (Minutes):**
> "Slop is production without history. Slop is detached from genuine human contribution. Slop born of effortless, replicable processes."

**PATTERN:** Repeat key word or phrase to hammer home point. Creates rhythm + memorability.

---

### Technique 3: Proper Nouns as Credibility

**Examples:**
- "Hummingbird had to get good at looking for these windows... There was Kraken (the crypto exchange which the team put 8% of the Turkish-mandate fund into for a 16.2% stake)" — Jordan Nel
- "The PayPal mafia is especially notorious, but Google/Facebook/Amazon/etc all have spawned similar networks. SpaceX has become a clear counterexample" — Mandel
- "Back then, Wall Street nicknamed the leaders the 'Four Horsemen' – Cisco, Intel, Dell, and Microsoft" — Edelweiss

**PATTERN:** Real names, real deals, real numbers. Not "some VCs" or "many founders." Specific = credible.

---

### Technique 4: Questions as Hooks

**Examples:**
> "The question isn't 'have they got it all figured out?' but rather 'are these people uniquely capable of figuring it out?'" — Jordan Nel

> "So, what do you think? Are we in the middle of a bubble—or just an early chapter of a genuine technological revolution?" — Edelweiss

**PATTERN:** Rhetorical questions that reframe the debate. Not seeking answers, redirecting thinking.

---

## IV. TOPIC ORGANIZATION

### A. LP/GP Selection & Due Diligence

**Key Articles:**
1. Jordan Nel — "An LPs Guide to Venture Funds (Part 1) - The Unbundling and a Framework"
2. Jordan Nel — "Venture Manager Selection: Capitalising on Arbitrage Windows"
3. PostRound — "What makes a round 'easy'"

**Core Insights:**
- GPs must do 8 things: source, pick, win, value, construct, king-make, raise, sell
- Venture is unbundling (knowledge democratization, personal branding, tooling, public→private shift)
- Arbitrage windows open and close — adaptation is key to GP longevity
- Two types of fundraises: Attention Spikes (team/traction) vs Explainers (requires building conviction)
- Capital stack positioning matters — where are the bottlenecks?

**Quote Bank:**
> "Each emerging manager looking to raise from LPs should have a very clear raison d'etre."

> "The question isn't 'have they got it all figured out?' but rather 'are these people uniquely capable of figuring it out?'"

> "Fundamentally [fundraising] is because investors are betting on an extremely distant future using extremely limited information... the best investments have been largely gut calls."

---

### B. Deep Tech & Technology Cycles

**Key Articles:**
1. Matthew Mandel — "Four Theses on Deep Tech"
2. Edelweiss — "Dot-Com Bubble vs. the AI Boom"

**Core Insights:**
- Software revolution primed hardware leap (decades of tool-building)
- Political consensus + capital flows supporting deep tech (ESG + hegemony)
- Talent virtuous cycles matter (SpaceX → space startups, role models drive talent)
- SPAC boom taught lesson: no shortcuts, must commercialize with real demand
- AI boom rhymes with dot-com: narrow leadership, capital flooding "anything AI," valuation disconnects
- Defensive positioning: staples, healthcare, commodities, EM (boring outperforms when narratives break)

**Quote Bank:**
> "When you prime a slingshot for launch, it appears to be moving backwards right before it dramatically springs forward."

> "Great technologies and great investments are not always the same thing, especially at euphoric valuations."

> "Your job isn't to call the top; it's to make sure that, when the music stops, you still own businesses that make money, not stories that need it."

---

### C. Founder Mindset & Ecosystem Dynamics

**Key Articles:**
1. Nikunj K — "Stop Being a Tourist"
2. PostRound — "What makes a round 'easy'"

**Core Insights:**
- Compound advantages only work if you stick around through cycles
- Tourists chase cycles, locals build through them
- Geographic arbitrage exists (SF in 2010s, now saturated)
- Missionaries don't flee when offerings dry up
- Tax optimization can cost you your edge (network, collisions, trust)
- Know if you're an Attention Spike or Explainer — build fundraising plan accordingly

**Quote Bank:**
> "Everyone claims they're missionaries, not mercenaries. But missionaries don't flee when offerings dry up."

> "They saved 13% and lost their edge."

> "Build through the bust. Hire when everyone's gone. Compounding advantages belong to whoever's still here when tourists return."

---

### D. Craft, AI, and Philosophy

**Key Articles:**
1. Minutes — "Craft Is the Antidote to Slop"

**Core Insights:**
- Labor is sacred vocation (Genesis 2:15), not punishment
- Slop = production without history, detached from human contribution
- LLMs can remove toil (emails, appeals) but shouldn't replace craft (poems, eulogies)
- When you use AI as leverage, you remain source; when you ask AI to remove your agency, something else becomes source
- Kingdom of God requires active participation through meaningful labor

**Quote Bank:**
> "The serpent's temptation represents the first shortcut in human history."

> "We can and should automate toil, but we must preserve craft."

> "Craft is the antidote to slop."

---

## V. KEY WRITING FRAMEWORKS EXTRACTED

### Framework 1: The 9-Step Essay (from Ana's Venture Protocol template)

Matched against these articles:

1. **Title** — Short, contrarian (✓ "Stop Being a Tourist", "Craft Is the Antidote to Slop")
2. **Opening Scene** — Emotional truth (✓ Group chats, Genesis, Markets aging)
3. **Core Belief** — Invisible spine (✓ All articles have this)
4. **Arguments** — 3-5 mini-paragraphs (✓ Framework delivery, numbered theses, contrast structure)
5. **Data Layer** — Specific stats (✓ Proper nouns, real numbers, insider knowledge)
6. **Personal Layer** — 2-3 mini-stories (✓ "After watching 300 Series As", "13 years in SF")
7. **Philosophical Close** — Widen perspective (✓ All strong endings do this)
8. **Thread Hooks** — Tweetable insights (✓ Quote-worthy lines throughout)
9. **Final Pass** — Rhythm, voice calibration (✓ Evident in polished pieces)

**Verdict:** Top Substack writers are unconsciously following Ana's essay framework. This validates the structure.

---

### Framework 2: The Insider Credibility Stack

**Layer 1: Lived Experience**
- Years in market ("13 years in SF", "After watching 300 Series As")
- Specific numbers tracked ("I tracked every founder who left. Forty-seven fled...")

**Layer 2: Proper Nouns**
- Real people ("Ileri met Atay [founder of BillionToOne]")
- Real companies ("Hummingbird... 8% of the Turkish-mandate fund into Kraken")
- Real deals ("USV, FCVC and IA Ventures 2010-2012 vintages did >20x")

**Layer 3: Private Knowledge**
- Conversations not public ("Barend wrote about the Peak Games investment...")
- Behind-the-scenes ("Ann [their head of IR] explained the suite to me...")

**Layer 4: Contrarian Take Backed by Experience**
- Not just "I think X", but "After Y years doing Z, I've learned X"
- Example: "Missionaries don't flee" — Nikunj can say this because he tracked who left and came back

**How to use:** Stack these layers in arguments. Don't claim authority, demonstrate it through specificity.

---

### Framework 3: The Arbitrage Window Thesis (Jordan Nel)

**Step 1:** Identify where capital is flowing
**Step 2:** Find where it's NOT flowing (the window)
**Step 3:** Assess talent/company quality in that window
**Step 4:** Evaluate capital stack — where's the bottleneck?
**Step 5:** Time the entry (early = low prices + less competition)
**Step 6:** Plan the exit (who are downstream buyers?)

**Applied examples in his writing:**
- New York in early 2010s (only handful of funds, all did 10-20x)
- Turkey gaming (Peak Games, first of kind, hired all best talent)
- BillionToOne (biotech from EM-mandate fund, now worth billions)

**How to use for content:** Structure essays around "where everyone's looking" vs "where opportunity actually is." Contrarian positioning.

---

### Framework 4: The Bubble Detection Checklist (Edelweiss)

**Indicator 1:** Valuations far from economic reality (private labs at hundreds of billions, burning cash)
**Indicator 2:** Capital flooding "just in case" (FOMO-driven, not fundamentals-driven)
**Indicator 3:** Few genuinely profitable use cases (AI companies buying from each other, not end customers)
**Indicator 4:** Perpetual disruption (6-month innovation cycles, nothing durable)
**Indicator 5:** Creative financing (suppliers funding clients, circular contracts, warrants for purchases)

**Then layer historical comparison:**
- Then: Four Horsemen (Cisco, Intel, Dell, Microsoft)
- Now: Magnificent Seven
- Then: Companies added ".com" to name
- Now: Companies add "AI partnership" to branding
- Then: Pets.com, Webvan failures
- Now: Neocloud speculative bets

**How to use for content:** When analyzing any hot sector, run through this checklist. Historical parallels make analysis more credible.

---

### Framework 5: The Two-Type Model (PostRound)

**Type A: Attention Spikes**
- Immediate excitement (team pedigree, viral traction)
- Investors fall over themselves
- Fast rounds, high competition
- Price driven by FOMO

**Type B: Explainers**
- Require founder to explain vision
- Benefit from pre-fundraise relationship building
- Slower rounds, fewer competitors
- Price driven by deep conviction
- Often more interesting long-term (lower pricing, founders know things others don't)

**The paradox:** Hard to know which you are until you're in the process

**How to use for content:** Binary frameworks are powerful. "Two types of X" structures force clear thinking and give readers immediate mental model.

---

## VI. ENGAGEMENT & DISTRIBUTION TACTICS

### Tactic 1: Tweetable Insights (Built-In Virality)

Every strong article has 5-10 lines that work as standalone tweets:

**From Nikunj:**
> "Tourists chase cycles. Locals build through them."  
> "Everyone claims they're missionaries, not mercenaries. But missionaries don't flee when offerings dry up."  
> "They saved 13% and lost their edge."

**From Jordan Nel:**
> "Each emerging manager looking to raise from LPs should have a very clear raison d'etre."  
> "The question isn't 'have they got it all figured out?' but rather 'are these people uniquely capable of figuring it out?'"

**From Edelweiss:**
> "Great technologies and great investments are not always the same thing, especially at euphoric valuations."

**Pattern:** These aren't accidents. Writers deliberately craft punchlines throughout. Often at end of sections or as standalone sentences.

---

### Tactic 2: Reference Stacking (Link to Credible Sources)

**Jordan Nel's technique:**
- Links to other Substacks (Generalist, NFX, etc.)
- Links to academic papers
- Links to fund websites
- Links to podcast timestamps

**Effect:** 
1. Signals deep research
2. Provides rabbit holes for engaged readers
3. Creates network effects (other writers notice links, reciprocate)

**Pattern:** 10-20+ hyperlinks per long-form piece. Not just decoration — each link adds credibility layer.

---

### Tactic 3: Data Visualization (When It Reveals)

**Edelweiss approach:**
- Charts showing private equity returns vs public markets
- Historical comparison graphs (Cisco vs Nvidia price movements)
- Capital allocation patterns

**Jordan Nel approach:**
- Tables comparing fund types
- Framework diagrams
- Data on funding to "democratize VC" companies

**Pattern:** Use visuals when they reveal something not obvious from text. Don't chart for chart's sake.

---

### Tactic 4: Footnotes (Academic Credibility)

**Jordan Nel extensively uses footnotes:**
> [1] "Most academic literature holds that non-random success (skill) leads to persistence... I disagree with this: it's not necessarily that they aren't lucky, they just lose their hunger and edge over time."

> [2] "Jerry Neumann, IA Ventures, and Founder Collective all co-invested in The Trade Desk's seed round in 2010"

**Effect:**
1. Main text stays clean and readable
2. Footnotes add depth for those who want it
3. Shows thoroughness without slowing narrative

**Pattern:** 2-5 footnotes per 5,000-word piece. Use for nuance, additional examples, or tangential points.

---

### Tactic 5: Call-to-Action (Relationship Building)

**PostRound ending:**
> "Email us if you want to make that plan better."

**Jordan Nel ending:**
> "If you're funding companies in these areas, or thinking about starting similar funds, please reach out (twitter, linkedin)."

**Mandel ending:**
> "If you're interested in any of the topics mentioned above, I'd love to chat. Follow me on Twitter or shoot me an email!"

**Pattern:** Not "subscribe for more" — instead "let's talk if this applies to you." Builds relationships, not just audience.

---

## VII. MISTAKES TO AVOID (Anti-Patterns)

### Anti-Pattern 1: Generic Openings

❌ **Bad:** "Venture capital is changing. Here's what you need to know."  
✅ **Good:** "Every group chat: 'Anyone know a recruiter?'" — immediate scene

❌ **Bad:** "In this post I'll explain the different types of fundraises."  
✅ **Good:** "After watching ~300 Series As and Bs..." — credibility first

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Data Without Insight

❌ **Bad:** "VC funding is down 30%."  
✅ **Good:** "I tracked every founder who left. Forty-seven fled... Forty-four are back."

❌ **Bad:** "Many companies failed during the dot-com crash."  
✅ **Good:** "Pets.com burned through capital with a flawed business model (costly shipping of pet food) and saw its stock collapse to cents per share before liquidating in late 2000."

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Vague Authority Claims

❌ **Bad:** "As an experienced investor, I think..."  
✅ **Good:** "After watching 300 Series As and Bs..."

❌ **Bad:** "Many experts agree that..."  
✅ **Good:** "Barend wrote about the Peak Games investment... 'Turkey was off-limits for investors.'"

---

### Anti-Pattern 4: Weak Endings

❌ **Bad:** "So that's my take on this topic. What do you think?"  
✅ **Good:** "Build through the bust. Hire when everyone's gone. They always return. And when they do, you'll own what they're desperately trying to buy."

❌ **Bad:** "In conclusion, venture capital is complex."  
✅ **Good:** "Ours is a livelihood dependent on successfully being able to predict the future. And in a world so dominated by fat tails, randomness and optionality, this is a very hard thing to do."

### Anti-Pattern 5: No Rhythm Variation

❌ **Bad:** Every sentence same length. Every paragraph same structure. Every section same cadence.  
✅ **Good:** Long setup. Short beat. Punchline. Then back to long analysis. Rhythm creates engagement.

## VIII. APPLYING THIS TO ANA'S CONTENT

### For Daily Briefing Posts (LinkedIn/X)

**Structure:**
1. **Open with scene or observation** (not "Here's the news")
   - Example: "Every LP call this week: 'Are we in a bubble?'"
2. **Core belief (1 line)**
   - Example: "Great technologies ≠ great investments at any price."
3. **Data point that reveals** (not generic stat)
   - Example: "Iris Energy: 90% revenue still Bitcoin mining, valued as 'next Nvidia of cloud.'"
4. **Personal angle** (what Ana knows that others don't)
   - Example: "From raising at Yellow Capital in 2021: everyone wanted upside. Nobody asked about duration."
5. **Close with insight, not summary**
   - Example: "The best funds aren't smarter. They're slower."

**Length:** 150-250 words (LinkedIn), 80-150 words (X)  
**Cadence:** Long → short → punch throughout

### For Weekly Essays (Venture Protocol)

**Use Ana's 9-step framework, informed by these patterns:**

1. **Title:** Contrarian, poetic (like "Stop Being a Tourist", not "How to Pick GPs")
2. **Opening:** Scene or personal moment (like Nikunj's group chats)
3. **Core Belief:** One-liner that acts as spine (Ana already does this well)
4. **Arguments:** Framework delivery (like Jordan Nel) or contrast structure (like Nikunj)
5. **Data:** Specific names, deals, numbers (proper nouns = credibility)
6. **Personal:** 2-3 mini-stories from Ana's experience ($1.1M Marsbase raise, $10M Yellow Capital IR build, 1000+ investor network)
7. **Philosophical Close:** Widen perspective (like all the strong endings)
8. **Thread Hooks:** Extract 5-10 tweetable lines for X distribution
9. **CTA:** "If you're building in MENA..." or similar relationship-building close

### For Infographics & Visual Content

**Based on Edelweiss approach:**
- Use data visualization when it reveals something not obvious
- Historical comparisons work (Then vs Now)
- Framework diagrams (like Ana's FO15 cascade: Large FOs → Mid-Size FOs → Emerging GPs)
- Caption should be tweetable insight, not just description

## X. FINAL SYNTHESIS: THE "ANA VOICE" FORMULA

**Based on all patterns + Ana's essay framework + her existing tone:**

### Opening (2-3 paragraphs)
- **Start with:** Scene, observation, or personal moment
- **Not:** Setup, background, or "in this essay I will..."
- **Example:** "Every GP pitch: 'We're thesis-driven, founder-friendly, value-add.' But when I ask about the last deal they passed on, silence."

### Core Belief (1-2 lines)
- **The spine:** What you believe, stated clearly
- **Make it tweetable:** This will become the quote everyone remembers
- **Example:** "The best GPs aren't prophets. They're pattern matchers with discipline."

### Arguments (3-5 sections)
- **Mix:** Narrative + data + insight
- **Use:** Proper nouns (real people, real deals, real numbers)
- **Structure:** Long → short → punch rhythm
- **Example section:**
  > "When Yellow Capital was raising $10M, we didn't pitch vision. We showed the IR infrastructure: pitch decks that converted, partner presentations that opened doors, outreach materials that got replies. The vision was in the execution. That's what LPs funded."

### Data Layer
- **Pick:** 2-3 stats that reveal insight (not generic "VC funding down")
- **Weave:** Naturally into narrative, don't just list
- **Example:** "Hummingbird put 8% of their Turkish-mandate fund into Kraken for a 16.2% stake. That's not portfolio construction. That's conviction."

### Personal Layer (2-3 mini-stories)
- **Show:** Your experience, don't claim authority
- **Be specific:** Names, dates, amounts, conversations
- **Example:**
  > "Raising for Marsbase in 2023: $1.1M from angels + institutional (WebWise, YAY Network, NovaCyber, Fractal). Not one asked about our go-to-market. Every single one wanted to know: 'Can you outlast a bear market?' That's when I learned — LPs don't fund optimism. They fund endurance."

### Philosophical Close (2-3 paragraphs)
- **Widen:** Perspective back out
- **Emotional:** Bring cadence back (like SF posts)
- **Memorable:** Last line should be quotable
- **Example:**
  > "Tourists chase narratives. Insiders build infrastructure. The difference isn't intelligence—it's endurance. When everyone flees the 'boring' markets, that's when generational companies get built. They always come crawling back. And when they do, you'll own what they're desperately trying to buy."

### Thread Hooks (Post-Publish)
- **Extract:** 5-10 tweetable lines
- **Post:** Throughout the week following essay
- **Engage:** Reply to relevant conversations with these insights

### CTA (Relationship Building)
- **Not:** "Subscribe for more"
- **Instead:** "If you're a GP raising in MENA, or an LP thinking about emerging managers, let's talk."

## CONCLUSION

**What makes LP/GP/founder Substack content exceptional:**

1. **Emotional truth before data** — scene-setting, personal moments, lived experience
2. **Insider credibility** — proper nouns (real names, deals, numbers), not theory
3. **Framework thinking** — reusable mental models, not one-off hot takes
4. **Rhythm mastery** — long → short → punch, repetition for emphasis, varied cadence
5. **Philosophical depth** — widen perspective at end, leave reader with reflection
6. **Tweetable insights** — quote-worthy lines throughout (built-in distribution)
7. **Relationship building** — CTAs that invite conversation, not just subscription

**Ana's unfair advantages:**
- $1.1M raised (Marsbase), $10M IR infrastructure built (Yellow Capital), $60M+ secondary deals, $350M+ tokenization pipeline
- 10 years crypto/tech, age 27 (young + experienced = rare combo)
- Podcast (Venture Protocol), 1000+ investor network, MENA/US/Asia reach
- Ukrainian in Dubai (unique perspective, cultural bridge)

**How to deploy these:**
- Every essay should demonstrate these advantages through specific stories, not claims
- Use "I" and "we" with precision: "When we were raising..." "In every LP call I take..."
- Geographic specificity: "Dubai/DIFC financial ecosystem", "MENA network patterns"
- Numbers that reveal: "$1.1M from angels + institutional: WebWise, YAY, NovaCyber, Fractal"

**The meta-lesson:**
All these writers are doing unconsciously what Ana has consciously systematized in her essay framework. That means Ana's framework is validated — and she can execute it with precision where others rely on instinct.
