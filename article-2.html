<strong>Why Family Offices Are Building In-House Capital Formation Teams (And Hiring Aggressively)</strong>

<strong>INTRO</strong>

In March 2025, CFA Institute published research on Middle East family offices with one line that caught my attention: "Hiring aggressively to boost their capabilities."

That's not normal language for a financial research report. "Aggressively" means something structural changed.

Family offices in Dubai are no longer just allocating capital to external funds. They're building in-house capital formation teams - hiring people who used to work at:
- PE/VC firms (IR roles)
- Fund placement agents
- Strategy consulting (Bain, McKinsey, BCG)
- Investment banks (fundraising teams)

I did IR for tech founders in Dubai, worked with family offices as allocators. This article breaks down why FOs are moving capital formation in-house - and what it means if you're in fundraising, IR, or capital raising.

<strong>1. The Economics Finally Make Sense</strong>

The Old Model (Outsourced):
- Family office has $500M AUM
- Wants to raise external capital for co-investments
- Hires placement agent at 2-3% of capital raised
- Raises $100M → pays $2-3M in fees

The New Model (In-House):
- Hire 2-3 capital formation professionals at $200K-$300K each
- Annual cost: $600K-$900K (all-in comp + overhead)
- They raise $100M → $0 external fees
- ROI breakeven: After first $30M-$40M raised

What Changed:
Family offices hitting critical mass ($500M+ AUM) where in-house teams are cheaper than outsourcing. The math flipped somewhere between 2023-2024.

Real Example:
Sirius Private Office (Dubai) is hiring for "Director, Capital Formation" roles. That's not a fund administrator position. That's building internal capability to raise capital without external agents.

<strong>2. Family Offices Are Going Direct (And Need IR Capability)</strong>

The Trend:
Family offices shifting from passive LP allocations to:
- Direct investments (no fund intermediary)
- Co-investments (alongside PE/VC funds)
- Secondaries (buying LP stakes)

CFA Institute (Mar 2025):
"More family offices are allocating capital to private equity funds, direct investments, and venture capital opportunities."

Why This Requires IR:
When you're doing directs/co-invests at scale, you need:
- Investor relations (managing co-investors)
- Deal flow (sourcing opportunities)
- Capital raising (for SPVs or fund vehicles)

That's not something you outsource to a placement agent. That's an in-house function.

The Talent Gap:
Most family offices came from:
- Real estate (property-focused)
- Operating businesses (industrial/trading)
- Oil wealth (passive allocations)

None of those backgrounds teach you how to run institutional-quality IR. So they're hiring externally.

<strong>3. The "Institutionalization" Wave</strong>

What's Happening:
Middle East family offices maturing from:
- "Family manages everything" → Professional management teams
- "Single LP in funds" → Multi-family office structures
- "Invest in friends' deals" → Institutional due diligence

CFA Institute Language:
"Adopting more institutionalized governance."

What That Means in Practice:
- Compliance teams
- Investment committees
- IR reporting (quarterly letters, investor portals)
- Capital formation (raising external capital properly)

Who Gets Hired:
People who've seen "good IR" at institutional funds. Ex-PE/VC IR folks who can build the function from scratch.

The Dubai Angle:
Dubai family offices are competing with Singapore/London FOs for deals. To compete, they need institutional credibility. That means professional IR teams.

<strong>4. The Consultant-to-FO Pipeline (This is Real)</strong>

The National (Sept 2025):
"People in strategy consulting are being hired by family offices from firms like Bain & Company, McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group."

Why Consultants?
- They speak "institutional investor" language
- They build decks/models LPs expect
- They understand governance structures
- They can set up processes from zero

The Career Path:
- Consultant → PE/VC firm (2-3 years) → Family office capital formation lead
- OR: Consultant → Family office directly (if FO is sophisticated)

Dubai Context:
Cordell Partners (Dubai exec search firm) confirmed this trend. Family offices hiring externally from "different regions and sectors."

That means: If you're doing IR in NY/London and open to Dubai, family offices want you.

<strong>5. The "Raise External Capital" Mandate</strong>

What's Driving This:
Family offices realizing they can:
- Raise capital from other HNWIs (friends/network)
- Structure as multi-family office (MFO)
- Charge management fees (1-1.5% AUM)
- Build recurring revenue business

The Shift:
From "we manage our family's money" → "we manage multiple families' money and raise external capital."

The National (Sept 2025):
"Those dealing with raising external capital are also sought after."

What This Requires:
Someone who knows how to:
- Build LP relationships
- Run fundraising processes
- Navigate regulatory (DIFC, SEC, MAS)
- Structure fund vehicles

That's a capital formation professional. Not an analyst. Not an advisor. Someone who's DONE fundraising at institutional scale.

<strong>6. Why Dubai Family Offices Specifically</strong>

The Factors:
1. Tax Migration: HNW families relocating to Dubai (0% personal income tax)
2. Golden Visas: 10-year residency = long-term commitment
3. DIFC Infrastructure: Regulatory framework for multi-family offices
4. Capital Concentration: $500M+ families clustering in one city
5. Network Effects: More families = more co-invest opportunities

The Result:
Dubai has critical mass of family offices at the same time they're all professionalizing. That creates hiring waves.

ME Family Office Summit:
"More than 100 family offices from the Middle East will gather in Dubai."

When 100+ FOs are in one city and they're all hiring similar roles, talent competition intensifies.

<strong>7. What This Means If You're in IR/Capital Formation</strong>

The Opportunity:
If you've done:
- LP relations at a PE/VC fund
- Fundraising at an investment bank
- Capital formation at a placement agent
- IR consulting

Dubai family offices are hiring for these roles RIGHT NOW.

Roles I'm Seeing:
- Director, Capital Formation
- Head of Investor Relations
- VP, External Capital Raising
- Managing Director, Family Office Partnerships

Compensation:
- $200K-$400K base (Dubai, tax-free)
- Carry/bonuses tied to capital raised
- Sometimes equity in the MFO structure

The Trade-Offs:
- Smaller teams (you're building from scratch)
- Less structure (you define the playbook)
- Higher impact (your work = direct ROI)

<strong>CONCLUSION</strong>

Family offices are moving capital formation in-house because:
1. Economics flipped (cheaper than outsourcing at scale)
2. Going direct requires IR capability
3. Institutionalization wave needs professional teams
4. Hiring ex-consultants who speak LP language
5. Raising external capital = recurring revenue
6. Dubai clustering accelerating trend
7. Talent gap = opportunity for external hires

If you're in IR/fundraising:
- Research family offices hiring in Dubai (Sirius, others)
- Connect with exec search firms (Cordell Partners, etc.)
- Understand multi-family office structures
- Be ready to build, not just execute

Or DM me - I'm exploring Director-level IR/capital formation roles in Dubai and happy to share what I've learned about the FO ecosystem.
