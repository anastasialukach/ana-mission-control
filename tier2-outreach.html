<div class="card">
<h2>🎯 TARGET 1: Sirius Private Office</h2>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> Director, Capital Formation<br>
<strong>Location:</strong> Dubai<br>
<strong>Why Excellent Fit:</strong> Private office capital formation = exactly your DNA</p>

<h3>Message Variation A (Value-First)</h3>
<blockquote>Hey [Name] -

Saw Sirius is building out capital formation in Dubai. I've been on both sides of that table - raised $10M for Yellow Capital (family offices), then ran Marsbase as CEO.

Have 3-4 intros to UAE-based family offices if helpful for your LP pipeline. Also just curious about Sirius's strategy - happy to grab coffee in DIFC this week.

No pressure if timing's off.

-Ana</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Value offer (FO intros), Dubai proximity, casual tone</p>

<h3>Message Variation B (Direct + Humble)</h3>
<blockquote>[Name] - quick question:

Is the Director role at Sirius still open? Im based in Dubai doing IR for family offices, ex-founder (raised $10M+), and this looks like the exact fit.

Would love to grab coffee and hear more about what your building. I'm in DIFC most days anyway.

Best,
Ana</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Direct ask, "Im" typo (human), "what your building" (casual), geographic advantage</p>

<h3>Message Variation C (Credibility Hook)</h3>
<blockquote>Hey [Name],

Been following Sirius's growth in Dubai - capital formation for private offices is exactly what I did at Yellow Capital ($10M raised for tech founders, mostly FO/HNW allocators).

Not sure if you're still hiring for the Director role, but would love to chat either way. Have some thoughts on Dubai's FO ecosystem + happy to make intros.

Coffee at DIFC this week?

<h3>Message Variation D (Insider Reference - if you find mutual connection)</h3>

Happy to share some insights on Dubai's allocator landscape or just grab coffee to learn more about what you're building.

Best,
