<h1>✉️ Cover Letter Templates</h1>
<div class="subtitle">3 templates • VC / FO / IB-focused • Copy and customize</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>Template 1: VC-Focused</h2>
<p><em>For Venture Capital IR Roles • Word count: 252</em></p>

<blockquote>Dear [FIRM] Team,

I'm writing to express my interest in the [ROLE] position at [FIRM]. With a proven track record advising on $70M+ in venture transactions and raising $10M+ in institutional capital, I bring both the deal execution rigor and LP relationship management capabilities that drive fund performance.

As CEO of Marsbase, I built a 1,000+ member investor network spanning 20+ family offices and 30+ HNWIs across MENA and Asia. I structured LP coverage frameworks, designed investor materials, and personally pitched institutional LPs—converting relationships into committed capital. My advisory work with Ironcore Partners on transactions including LayerZero ($1.2B→$3B+), Fuel ($1B→$2B+), and CoinGecko (~$300M+ EV) sharpened my ability to articulate value propositions to sophisticated allocators.

Beyond capital deployment, I understand the investor relations side intimately. I've managed quarterly reporting cycles, cultivated co-investment opportunities, and ensured LPs remain engaged through transparent communication and exclusive access. My positioning in Dubai—where I co-host Tech Tuesday for 200+ weekly attendees and produce Venture Protocol Podcast—has established me as a trusted connector within the region's institutional and emerging tech ecosystems.

I thrive in environments where strategy meets execution. Whether it's crafting positioning for first-time funds, managing anchor LP relationships, or supporting portfolio value creation through network leverage, I bring operational intensity and a builder's mentality.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience aligns with [FIRM]'s growth objectives.

Best regards,  
Anastasia</blockquote>

<h2>Template 2: FO-Focused</h2>
<p><em>For Family Office Capital Formation/IR Roles • Word count: 254</em></p>

<blockquote>Dear [FIRM] Team,

I'm reaching out regarding the [ROLE] opportunity at [FIRM]. Having spent the last three years building relationships with 20+ family offices and 30+ HNWIs across Dubai, Singapore, and Europe, I understand what sophisticated allocators value: access, discipline, and partnership—not just returns.

My background bridges institutional rigor with entrepreneurial adaptability. At Yellow (Senior Manager, IR & BD), I raised $10M+ in direct capital, designed investor decks, and pitched family offices on multi-stage investment strategies. As CEO of Marsbase, I cultivated a 1,000+ investor network, facilitated co-investment opportunities, and structured deal flow for discretionary allocators seeking alpha in emerging sectors.

I've also advised on $70M+ in venture and M&A transactions, including LayerZero ($1.2B→$3B+), Fuel ($1B→$2B+), and CoinGecko (~$300M+ EV) through Ironcore Partners. This dual lens—capital formation and transaction execution—allows me to speak credibly to both principals and investment committees about risk, structure, and portfolio fit.

Positioned in Dubai, I co-host Tech Tuesday (200+ weekly attendees) and produce Venture Protocol Podcast, which keeps me embedded in the region's institutional capital and innovation networks. I understand the cultural nuances of engaging Middle Eastern and Asian family offices—relationships built on trust, not pitch decks.

I'd value the chance to explore how my LP network and capital formation expertise can support [FIRM]'s strategy.

Best regards,

<h2>Template 3: IB/Placement-Focused</h2>
<p><em>For Investment Banks & Placement Agents • Word count: 268</em></p>

<blockquote>Dear [FIRM] Team,

I'm writing to apply for the [ROLE] position at [FIRM]. With experience executing $70M+ in M&A and venture advisory mandates, raising $10M+ in institutional capital, and managing LP relationships across 20+ family offices, I bring the transactional execution and investor coverage capabilities that drive successful placements.

Through my work with Ironcore Partners, I advised on transactions including LayerZero ($1.2B→$3B+), Fuel ($1B→$2B+), and CoinGecko (~$300M+ EV)—managing sell-side positioning, investor outreach, and deal structuring. As Senior Manager of IR & BD at Yellow, I designed pitch materials, structured fundraising processes, and closed commitments from institutional LPs. These experiences taught me how to navigate complex stakeholder dynamics, manage confidential processes, and deliver outcomes under pressure.

I've also built a 1,000+ member investor network spanning family offices, HNWIs, and institutional allocators across MENA, Asia, and Europe. As CEO of Marsbase, I ran quarterly LP updates, facilitated co-investments, and maintained continuous engagement with capital partners. My positioning in Dubai—where I co-host Tech Tuesday for 200+ weekly attendees—has deepened my access to regional capital allocators and decision-makers.

Whether it's managing a fundraise roadshow, executing a secondary placement, or covering buy-side LPs for fund marketing, I operate with the urgency and precision that capital markets demand. I'm comfortable in high-stakes environments and driven by getting deals closed.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to [FIRM]'s transaction pipeline.

Best regards,  
Anastasia</blockquote>
