<h1>🎯 Tier-2 Personalized Outreach Messages</h1>
<div class="meta">Created: Feb 19, 2026 | Status: Ready to send | 7 targets, 25+ message variations</div>

<p><strong>Format:</strong> 3-4 variations per target for you to choose from. Each message designed to sound human, not AI-generated.</p>

</div>

<div class="message-card">
<h4>Message Variation A (Value-First)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey [Name] -</p>
<p>Saw Sirius is building out capital formation in Dubai. I've been on both sides of that table - raised $10M for Yellow Capital (family offices), then ran Marsbase as CEO.</p>
<p>Have 3-4 intros to UAE-based family offices if helpful for your LP pipeline. Also just curious about Sirius's strategy - happy to grab coffee in DIFC this week.</p>
<p>No pressure if timing's off.</p>

</div>

<div class="message-card">
<h4>Message Variation B (Direct + Humble)</h4>

<p>Would love to grab coffee and hear more about what your building. I'm in DIFC most days anyway.</p>
<p>Best,<br>Ana</p>
