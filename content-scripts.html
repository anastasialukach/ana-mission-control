  <div class="script-header">
    <div class="script-title">Script 1: "The Cold Email That Gets Family Offices to Reply"</div>
    <div class="script-tags">
      <span class="tag tag-green">5-10K views</span>
      <span class="tag tag-yellow">Actionable</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="meta"><strong>Hook type:</strong> Specific result + curiosity gap<br><strong>Film:</strong> Talking head, DIFC office or café</div>
  
  <blockquote><strong>HOOK:</strong> "This cold email template got me a 40% response rate from family offices. Most people get 5%."

<strong>CONTEXT:</strong> "I've raised over $10 million from family offices and HNWIs in the Gulf. Here's what I learned about what actually gets opened."

<strong>VALUE:</strong> "Three rules. One — lead with value, not an ask. Offer an intro, a data point, something useful before you want anything. Two — be weirdly specific. 'I noticed your Q3 allocation to real assets increased' hits different than 'I'd love to connect.' Three — keep it to five sentences. Family offices get 200 emails a day. Yours needs to be the one they can read in 15 seconds."

<strong>CTA:</strong> "Want me to break down the actual templates? Comment 'TEMPLATE' and I'll send them."</blockquote>

  <p style="font-size:13px;color:var(--muted);margin-top:8px"><strong>Why this works:</strong> Specific number (40% vs 5%) = instant credibility · Actionable advice · CTA drives engagement · Positions Ana as insider</p>
</div>

<!-- Script 2 -->
<div class="card">
  <div class="script-header">
    <div class="script-title">Script 2: "Why I Left Crypto After 10 Years"</div>
    <div class="script-tags">
      <span class="tag tag-green">10-20K views</span>
      <span class="tag tag-red">Viral potential</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="meta"><strong>Hook type:</strong> Contradiction + origin story<br><strong>Film:</strong> Walking in DIFC or Dubai Marina, casual vibe</div>
  
  <blockquote><strong>HOOK:</strong> "I started working in crypto at 17. Built a career. Became a CEO. And then I walked away."

<strong>CONTEXT:</strong> "10 years in crypto and tech — raised capital, led a company, sourced deals worth billions in paper value. LayerZero, Fuel, CoinGecko — I was in the room."

<strong>VALUE:</strong> "But here's what nobody tells you about crypto: the smartest people I met weren't building tokens. They were building relationships with family offices, sovereign funds, and institutional LPs. The money behind the money. That's where the real game is. Capital formation — connecting the best funds with the best capital. No hype cycles. No 'this time is different.' Just people, trust, and allocation decisions."

<strong>CTA:</strong> "Follow if you want to see what finance actually looks like from the inside. Not the Twitter version."</blockquote>

  <p style="font-size:13px;color:var(--muted);margin-top:8px"><strong>Why this works:</strong> "Left crypto" is contrarian = scroll stopper · Origin story (started at 17) creates emotional investment · Real deal names = credibility · Appeals to crypto AND trad finance audiences</p>
</div>

<!-- Script 3 -->
<div class="card">
  <div class="script-header">
    <div class="script-title">Script 3: "What Family Offices Actually Look For"</div>
    <div class="script-tags">
      <span class="tag tag-green">5-8K views</span>
      <span class="tag tag-yellow">Insider</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="meta"><strong>Hook type:</strong> Myth-busting + insider knowledge<br><strong>Film:</strong> Sitting at a café, casual, like telling a friend</div>
  
  <blockquote><strong>HOOK:</strong> "I've sat across from 20+ family offices in the Gulf. Not one of them asked to see a pitch deck first."

<strong>CONTEXT:</strong> "After raising $10M from family offices and managing relationships with over a thousand investors, here's what I can tell you—"

<strong>VALUE:</strong> "Family offices don't invest in presentations. They invest in people they trust. The first meeting is never about your fund. It's about: Can I have dinner with this person? Do they understand my family's values? Will they pick up the phone when things go wrong? If you're approaching a family office with a cold deck and a data room link, you've already lost. Start with coffee. Start with a genuine question about THEIR portfolio. Start with giving before asking."

<strong>CTA:</strong> "Biggest mistake I see founders make with FOs? I'll cover that next. Follow so you don't miss it."</blockquote>

  <p style="font-size:13px;color:var(--muted);margin-top:8px"><strong>Why this works:</strong> Busts common assumption (pitch deck) · Insider perspective that can't be Googled · Actionable framework (coffee > deck) · Series potential</p>
</div>

<!-- Script 4 -->
<div class="card">
  <div class="script-header">
    <div class="script-title">Script 4: "Dubai Changed How I Think About Money"</div>
    <div class="script-tags">
      <span class="tag tag-green">10-15K views</span>
      <span class="tag tag-yellow">Dubai</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="meta"><strong>Hook type:</strong> Geographic + lifestyle contrast<br><strong>Film:</strong> Dubai skyline, DIFC, transition shots</div>
  
  <blockquote><strong>HOOK:</strong> "I moved to Dubai from Ukraine. The first thing I noticed? Nobody here talks about salaries. They talk about deal flow."

<strong>CONTEXT:</strong> "I'm 27, working in capital formation in DIFC. I've lived in enough places to know — Dubai runs on a completely different financial operating system."

<strong>VALUE:</strong> "In most cities, wealth is about your paycheck. In Dubai, it's about your network. I've met more family offices at a Tuesday lunch than most people meet in a year of cold outreach. The guy next to you at a café manages $500M. The woman at the networking event just closed a $2B fund. And the thing is — they're all accessible. Dubai is small enough that two warm intros can get you to almost anyone. That's not true in London. It's not true in New York. It's uniquely true here."

<strong>CTA:</strong> "If you're thinking about Dubai for finance — ask me anything in the comments."</blockquote>

  <p style="font-size:13px;color:var(--muted);margin-top:8px"><strong>Why this works:</strong> Geographic contrast = broad appeal · "From Ukraine" adds personal depth · Paints Dubai as accessible (aspirational) · Comment CTA drives engagement</p>
</div>

<!-- Script 5 -->
<div class="card">
  <div class="script-header">
    <div class="script-title">Script 5: "The $10M I Raised Started With One Coffee Meeting"</div>
    <div class="script-tags">
      <span class="tag tag-green">5-8K views</span>
      <span class="tag tag-yellow">Story</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="meta"><strong>Hook type:</strong> Specific number + origin story<br><strong>Film:</strong> Coffee shop in DIFC, close-up talking head</div>
  
  <blockquote><strong>HOOK:</strong> "The $10 million I raised for Yellow Capital started with one coffee in DIFC. No pitch deck. No data room. Just a conversation."

<strong>CONTEXT:</strong> "I was 25. No Goldman on my resume. No family connections. Just a Ukrainian girl in Dubai who understood one thing—"

<strong>VALUE:</strong> "People give money to people they trust. Not to slide decks. That first meeting wasn't me pitching. It was me asking a family office principal what keeps him up at night about his portfolio. He talked for 40 minutes. I listened. At the end he said: 'Send me your terms.' That $2M check led to introductions. Those introductions led to $10M. Every dollar I've ever raised started with listening, not talking."

<strong>CTA:</strong> "Comment 'COFFEE' if you want to hear the three questions I ask in every first meeting."</blockquote>

  <p style="font-size:13px;color:var(--muted);margin-top:8px"><strong>Why this works:</strong> Specific ($10M, $2M check, 40 minutes) = hyper-credible · Underdog angle (25, Ukrainian, no Goldman) = relatable · Counterintuitive lesson (listening > pitching)</p>
</div>

<!-- Script 6 -->
<div class="card">
  <div class="script-header">
    <div class="script-title">Script 6: "3 Things I'd Tell My 17-Year-Old Self About Finance"</div>
    <div class="script-tags">
      <span class="tag tag-green">8-12K views</span>
      <span class="tag tag-yellow">Advice</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="meta"><strong>Hook type:</strong> Timeframe tension + reflection<br><strong>Film:</strong> Walking shot, reflective tone, Dubai in background</div>
  
  <blockquote><strong>HOOK:</strong> "I started working in finance at 17 in Kyiv. I'm 27 in Dubai now. Here's what I wish someone told me."

<strong>CONTEXT:</strong> [no extra context needed — the hook IS the context]

<strong>VALUE:</strong> "One. Your network is not your LinkedIn connections. It's the 10 people who would take your call at midnight. Invest in depth, not breadth. Two. Nobody cares about your title. They care about what you can DO. I've seen analysts outperform MDs because they actually understood the LP's portfolio. Be useful, not impressive. Three. The best career moves feel like mistakes when you make them. Leaving crypto after 10 years felt insane. Turns out it was the smartest thing I ever did."

<strong>CTA:</strong> "What would YOU tell your younger self? Drop it in the comments."</blockquote>

  <p style="font-size:13px;color:var(--muted);margin-top:8px"><strong>Why this works:</strong> 17→27 timeframe = instant curiosity · Kyiv→Dubai journey = compelling arc · Advice format = high save/share rate · Comment CTA = engagement driver</p>
</div>

<!-- Script 7 -->
<div class="card">
  <div class="script-header">
    <div class="script-title">Script 7: "Why 90% of Cold Outreach to Investors Fails"</div>
    <div class="script-tags">
      <span class="tag tag-green">5-8K views</span>
      <span class="tag tag-red">Actionable</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="meta"><strong>Hook type:</strong> Statistic + pain point<br><strong>Film:</strong> Sitting at desk or walking, direct-to-camera</div>
  
  <blockquote><strong>HOOK:</strong> "90% of cold outreach to investors goes straight to trash. I've been on both sides — here's why."

<strong>CONTEXT:</strong> "I've sent hundreds of cold emails as a fundraiser. And I've received hundreds as a CEO managing a thousand-investor pipeline."

<strong>VALUE:</strong> "The emails that get deleted all have the same problem: they start with 'I.' 'I'm reaching out.' 'I'd love to connect.' 'I think we'd be a great fit.' Nobody cares about you yet. The emails that get replies start with THEM. 'I noticed your fund just closed a $200M raise — congrats.' 'Your LP letter mentioned increasing alt allocation — I have 3 FO intros that might be relevant.' Lead with what you KNOW about them, offer something valuable, and keep it to 5 sentences. That's it. That's the whole secret."

<strong>CTA:</strong> "Save this. And if you want the actual template, comment 'COLD' and I'll send it."</blockquote>

  <p style="font-size:13px;color:var(--muted);margin-top:8px"><strong>Why this works:</strong> "90%" = specific, scroll-stopping · "Both sides" = unique credibility (sender AND receiver) · Immediately actionable · Save/share-worthy</p>
